## pycast

A independent implementation of chromecast protocol for linux based on python3.

## Description

Currently, at today version, pychromecast doesn't work fine with pychromecast, sorry, 
it's an awesome project, but it's not the first time that I have problems with it.

The final idea is share local screen with a chromecast on linux without pychromecast.

## Current status

At this moment, I can detect and send messages to chromecast, we're talking but I need to know more about 
the message protocol (Google doesn't offer any documentation about it). 

So there is a possible implementation for all. 

I need to decrypt the protocol data to see if it's correct but I can send message to chromecast with Google protocol, so
I will try to do a chromecast implementation independent of pychromecast library.
