## pycast

A independent implementation of chromecast protocol for linux based on python3.

## Description

Currently, at today version, pychromecast doesn't work fine with pychromecast, sorry, 
it's an awesome project, but it's not the first time that I have problems with it.

The final idea is share local screen with a chromecast on linux without pychromecast.

## Current status

At this moment, I can detect and send messages to chromecast, also open media player and send video. 
We're talking but Google doesn't offer any documentation about it.
